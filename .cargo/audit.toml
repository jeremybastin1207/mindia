[advisories]
# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa 0.9.10 - Marvin Attack timing sidechannel
# No fixed upgrade available. Comes from sqlx-mysql (transitive via sqlx-macros).
# Project uses PostgreSQL only; mysql support is not used.
#
# RUSTSEC-2025-0058: custom_derive crate is unmaintained (INFO advisory)
# Transitive via conv -> imageproc -> mindia-processing.
# This project does not directly depend on custom_derive; we will track this
# and upgrade imageproc or its replacements once upstream support is available.
#
# RUSTSEC-2024-0436: paste crate is unmaintained (INFO advisory)
# Transitive via utoipa-axum, nalgebra/simba, and rav1e -> ravif -> image.
# This project does not directly use paste; we will rely on upstream crates
# to migrate to maintained alternatives (e.g. pastey / with_builtin_macros).
#
# RUSTSEC-2025-0134: rustls-pemfile is unmaintained (INFO advisory)
# Transitive via reqwest. Migration path is for HTTP/TLS libraries to adopt
# rustls-pki-types directly; this project is not in a position to fix reqwest.
#
# RUSTSEC-2026-0002: lru IterMut unsoundness
# Transitive via aws-sdk-s3. Our code does not use IterMut from lru directly
# and uses AWS SDK caches in a read/lookup fashion only; we accept this risk
# while tracking upstream fixes in aws-sdk-s3.
