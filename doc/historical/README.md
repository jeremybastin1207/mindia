# Historical Documentation

This folder contains documentation about **completed architectural decisions, refactorings, and migrations** that have already been implemented in the codebase.

These documents are preserved for historical context and to understand past design decisions, but they do not reflect current development priorities or ongoing work.

## Purpose

- **Reference**: Understand why certain architectural decisions were made
- **Context**: See the evolution of the codebase structure
- **Lessons**: Learn from past refactoring approaches

## Current Documentation

For current architecture, development practices, and active documentation, see:
- **Developer Docs**: [`../developer/README.md`](../developer/README.md)
