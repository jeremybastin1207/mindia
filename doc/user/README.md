# Mindia User Documentation

Welcome to the Mindia API documentation! This guide is designed for developers building applications that integrate with Mindia's media management API.

## What is Mindia?

Mindia is a high-performance media management service built with Rust. It provides a complete RESTful API for:

- **Image Management** - Upload, transform, and serve images with on-the-fly resizing
- **Video Streaming** - HLS adaptive bitrate streaming with automatic transcoding
- **Audio Storage** - Audio file management with metadata extraction
- **Document Management** - PDF storage and retrieval
- **Folder Organization** - Hierarchical folder structure for organizing media
- **File Groups** - Group related files and download as archives
- **Plugins** - Extend functionality with plugins (e.g., audio transcription)
- **Task Management** - Monitor and manage background processing tasks
- **Semantic Search** - Natural language search across all media types
- **Webhooks** - Real-time event notifications
- **Analytics** - Traffic, storage, and usage metrics
