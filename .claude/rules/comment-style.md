# Comment Style

**Keep comments concise and coherent with the project.**

## Guidelines

- **Concise** – Write short, clear comments. Avoid obvious restatements of code. Prefer one line when sufficient.
- **Coherent** – Use project terminology, conventions, and tone consistently. Align with existing comment style.
- **Purposeful** – Comment *why* when non-obvious, not *what*. Code should be self-explanatory for *what*.

## Avoid

- Verbose or redundant comments
- Comments that drift from project conventions
- Out-of-date comments that no longer match the code
