# Document Transformations

Current behavior and options for documents in Mindia.

## Current behavior

Documents (PDFs) are **served as stored**. Mindia does not perform on-the-fly transformation or conversion for documents. After upload, files are delivered at their original format.

**What Mindia provides for documents:**

- Upload and storage (PDF)
- Automatic text extraction for semantic search
- Direct download via the API

For full details on uploading, listing, and downloading documents, see [Documents](documents).

## Future

On-the-fly document transformations (e.g. page range, format conversion, or thumbnail generation) may be added in future releases.
